# Hotel Booking Analysis using Python

## üìò Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data from a **City Hotel** and a **Resort Hotel** to understand the factors driving high cancellation rates and provide actionable recommendations to minimize cancellations and maximize revenue.  
Both hotels have faced challenges such as **reduced revenue** and **underutilized room capacity** due to high cancellation rates.

This analysis was conducted as part of a **Data Analysis Portfolio Project**, using **Python (Google Colab)** for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), and **Power BI** for potential dashboard visualization.

## üíº Business Problem

In recent years, both **City Hotel** and **Resort Hotel** have been facing **high cancellation rates**, resulting in **revenue loss** and **inefficient room utilization**.  
The objective of this project is to identify the factors influencing these cancellations and to develop data-driven strategies to reduce them, improve efficiency, and increase profitability.

## üìã Assumptions

- Events between 2015 and 2017 do not significantly impact the dataset.  
- The data remains relevant for current hotel operations.  
- The recommended strategies will not lead to negative business impacts.  
- The hotels are not yet applying these recommendations.  
- Booking cancellations significantly affect hotel revenue.  
- Most bookings and cancellations occur within the same year.

## ‚ùì Research Questions & Hypotheses

### Research Questions
1. What variables influence hotel reservation cancellations?  
2. How can hotels minimize reservation cancellations?  
3. How can pricing and promotional strategies be optimized?

### Hypotheses
1. Cancellation rates increase with higher **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**.  
2. Longer **waiting lists** lead to more frequent cancellations.  
3. **Offline travel agents** contribute more reservations than online channels.
